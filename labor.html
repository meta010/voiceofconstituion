            <h4>Labor rights protection</h4>
            <p>A large section of the Indian society works in private places, since these are private companies and work, the government's salary and working rules do not apply here, due to which there is a danger of harassment of employees. Many big contractors hire small laborers and pay a lot after getting 10-12 hours of work done, so the constitutional rights for laborers and employees are mentioned.

                Fair wages and bonuses for employees
                
                The whole point of providing service for an employee is fair and reasonable remuneration. Article 39(d) of the Constitution provides for equal pay for equal work. Equal Remuneration ActThe law, under the Payment of Wages Act, mandates timely and fair remuneration of an employee. If an employee is not getting his remuneration as per the employment agreement, he can approach the Labor Commissioner or file a civil suit for back wages. As per the law no employee can be paid less than the statutory minimum wage.
                 payment of bonus
                 Paying bonuses to its employees regardless of loss or profit to an organization Needed, whose salary is Rs. 21000/- as per the procedure envisaged in the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965.

                  leave and other leave. For every 240 days worked, an employee is entitled to 12 days of annual leave. An adult worker can take one earned leave every 20 days while it is 15 days for a youth worker. During the notice period, an employee may take leave for emergencies, provided the employment contract does not prohibit it.



                  Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace
                  
                  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention)(Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 protects women from sexual harassment at workplace. The Indian Penal Code also provides for imprisonment of up to three years, with or without fine, for sexual assault.
                  
                  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention)As per [section 2n] of the (Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 "sexual harassment" includes any one or more of the following unwelcome acts or behavior (whether directly or by implication):â€”
                  
                  I. physical contact and advances, Or
                  
                  Second. a demand or request for sexual favors, Or
                  
                  Third. making sexually colored comments, Or
                  
                  iv. showing obscenity; Or
                  
                  v. any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature;

                  For organizations with ten or more employees, An Internal Complaints Committee should be constituted to assist the victims of sexual harassment. The law mandates that such organizations have a grievance redressal policy and mechanism in place that outlines sexual harassment, penalties, redressal mechanisms, etc. The committee has one senior woman as member, two other employees as members and one non-official member. The detailed duties of an employer are available in this article.
                  
                  My attempt here is just to demystify the terminology used with an employee who doesn't fully understand it and doesn't agree to it. HR or the company won't always educate you about all of this. it's not their jobRather, it is your job to know about your rights.
                  
                  This is by no means an exhaustive list of rights and obligations of an employee under the laws and regulations. There are a number of laws governing various aspects of labor and employment laws.
                  
                  The incident of sexual harassment of a woman at the workplace is a violation of her fundamental right to gender equality under Article 16(2) of the Indian Constitution.
